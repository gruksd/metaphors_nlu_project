# Task 3 annotation instructions

In the `data` directory there are two `.tsv` files,
each containing 184 words and their definitions.
Each row of each file contains one headword labeled `word`,
three definition glosses for it, and an empty field labeled `more_similar`.
Your task is to decide whether the word sense given by `gloss1` is
more similar to the one given by `gloss2a` or `gloss2b`.
Please indicate your decision by marking either `a` or `b` in the
`more_similar` field, even if the differences between the glosses are minute.
