# Annotation guidelines

Differentiate between:

Task fail: 
* Did not paraphrase as teached (meaning to produce only 1 word) --> annotate 0a
* Used one word which has nothing to do with the highlighted word --> 0b
* Used the same word, no paraphrase --> annotate 0c

Paraphrased:
* Paraphrased word in a literal sense --> annotate 1a
* Paraphrased word with a word in the right domain --> annotate 1b
* Paraphrased word in a metaphorical sense, but wrong --> annotate 2
* Paraphrased word in a metaphorical sense and similar to the human annotators --> annotate 3a
* Paraphrased word in a metaphorical sense and exactly as one of the human annotators --> annotate 3b
